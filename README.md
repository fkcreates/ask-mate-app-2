# ask-mate-app-2
Ask mate is a StackOverflow-like application, so users can ask questions, answer the and comment as well. 
Upvoting and downvoting features work as well. 
There is a login option to separate registered users from non-registered users when using specific features.

This was a 3 weeks-long project in the Web module in CodeCool programming school.

We have mainly used Python, Flask and SQL database to develop this application.
